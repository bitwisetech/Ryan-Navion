nav-srce-pbs


  This instrument is a three-way radio push-button to set nav-source index for HSI and autopilot.
It's based on the RMI instrument from Helijah's Lancair-235 with the'TAC' label replaced with 'GPS'
for nav-source index value 2; this is the only change to the png image so the image file shows the 
full RMI face and pointers.  The .xml and .ac file are chopped so that only the pushbutton switches
are displayed.
